Requirements:

- Python , Pandas , Numpy
	Link to install Python :
	https://www.python.org/downloads/
	Once you have python(preferable Anaconda/miniconda) installed, install pandas and numpy
	
	conda install pandas
	conda install numpy

- File Paths declared in the program
	ZIPS_CSV_PATH = "./input_data/zips.csv"
	PLANS_CSV_PATH = "./input_data/plans.csv"
	SLCSP_CSV_PATH = "./input_data/slcsp.csv"
	
	OUTPUT_SLCSP_CSV_PATH = "./Output_slcsp.csv"
	This file contains the output with the rates for the desired zipcodes ONLY if you don't
	 wish to update the original slcsp.csv file.
	The program takes a user input to confirm the same
	
  Main folder: Coding_Excercise : Contains: input_data --> Has all the needed input csv files
                                          COMMENTS --> Details of the program
                                          run_slcsp.py --> The code
                                          
  Kindly run the program from the Coding_Exercise directory:
	
		              python run_slcsp.py
	
-->Run the program :

-     python run_slcsp.py -help   
      
      		To view the options

- 	  python run_slcsp.py

	 		This will print the zipcodes and the respective slcsp rates on 'stdout' and ask the user input
	 		to either create a new file  OUTPUT_SLCSP_CSV_PATH or update the  SLCSP_CSV_PATH	
	
-     python run_slcsp.py zip1 zip2 . . 
	
			This will print the zipcodes and the respective slcsp rates of the zipcodes passed on the screen
			and will also ask the user to input if they would like to write the full output to the
			OUTPUT_SLCSP_CSV_PATH or update the  SLCSP_CSV_PATH
	


Notes:

Thank you for taking the time to review my the assignment. It has been quite a learning experience.
This is my first time using pandas and dataframes. To begin the the assignment, I started with python petl for ETL functions but
I got stuck when I had to find the second smallest number. 
Restarted by studying dataframes and what could be done with them. The code could surely be improved
by using other methods like set() which I did try but there was a glitch one way or the other.
I surely have done my best and would appreciate your feedback on what and where I could improve in my approach.
Thank you!
#TODO, TO learn : Pandas set(), aggregate(), transforming functions.
